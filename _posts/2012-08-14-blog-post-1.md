Recently I had the opportunity to contribute a short piece on painted turtles to the [Loudoun Wildlife Conservancy's](https://loudounwildlife.org/) quarterly publication, "The Habitat Herald." I've always been interested in scientific writing for a more general audience, and this was a wonderful chance to break out of my manuscript-writing mindset. Check it out here on [p. 15](https://loudounwildlife.org/themencode-pdf-viewer/?file=https://loudounwildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Habitat-Herald-2017-Spring5-5-2017.pdf).
